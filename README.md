I'm an enthusiastic UI artist 🦚 with a passion for creating stunning user experiences. As a versatile UX/DX designer 🎠, I love crafting seamless interactions that delight users and developers alike. In addition to being a client/server programmer/architect ♟️, I am also deeply immersed in the world of game development 🎮.

But wait, there's more to me than just my professional pursuits! I proudly embrace my roles as a devoted full-time father and husband 👨‍👩‍👦. In my spare time, you'll find me practicing morning yoga 🧘‍♂️, meditating during the day 🙏, and hitting the gym at night 💪.

🐱‍🐉 Fun fact: I could be a vegetarian if I wasn't a steak lover 🥩

I bring my dreams to life using a powerful toolkit, including Python, JavaScript, and C#. I work with frameworks such as Flask, Node.js, Next.js, React Native, and Unity, and I harness the potential of tools like Tailwind, Rive, MongoDB, Three.js, Docker, Kubernetes, and many others to build extraordinary projects.

Let's connect and create something amazing together! 🚀

I'm a super passionate UI artist :peacock:<br /> a creative UX/DX designer :carousel_horse:<br />a client/server programmer/architect :chess_pawn:<br />
and a game developer :video_game: <br />

I use Python, Javascript and C# in Flask, Node.js, Next.js, React Native and Unity alongside with Tailwind, Rive, MongoDB, Three.js, Docker, Kubertenes and many many other great tools to bring my dreams alive.
